# Online Privacy is a Myth
========================

*by David Evenden*

* * * * *

When I went to the Tribe of Hackers conference a few weeks ago Marcus Carey asked 10 willing attendees to spend one minute answering a question in front of everyone. The first question was "what do you think will change in cyber security in the next 5 years?". I was so focused on that question I don't even remember the second question.

I encouraged Kylie Martonik ([@0xNBE1Â ](https://twitter.com/0xNBE1)) to go up because she's braver than me, and was willing to share her answer. If I had the courage at the time, this is what I would have said.Â *I should also note that this answer is a good answer to the first question asked to all the contributors of the book The Tribe of Hackers "Is there one myth that you could debunk in cybersecurity?"*.

It's a good thing I didn't go up in front of everyone, because this answer would have taken more than one minute. Also I'm about to sound like a conspiracy theorist...trust me I'm not.

Privacy in today's world is 100% a myth.
